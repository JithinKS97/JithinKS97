Hi, Thanks for visiting my profile. My name is Jithin KS and I'm a Fullstack developer. Lately, I have gained a deep interest in web3 and blockchain and have been exploring it.

### My works
#### [Contributions to Ethernaut](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut)
1. Developed a [statistics contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut/blob/master/contracts/contracts/metrics/Statistics.sol) to keep track of the [activities of the user](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x7ae0655F0Ee1e7752D7C62493CEa1E69A810e2ed#readProxyContract).
2. Helped develop and deploy [script](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut-leaderboard) that crawls data in the blockchain to prepare and display leaderboard.
